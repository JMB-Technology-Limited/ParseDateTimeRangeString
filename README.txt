ParseDateTimeRangeString PHP Composer Library
=============================================

Takes in a string representing a date time range, the current time and timezone.
Hopefully returns two \DateTime objects with start and end time.

Currently horribly European & English centric. Sorry.

Rules for version numbers:
Minor upgrades (x.x.+1) will not change the API.
